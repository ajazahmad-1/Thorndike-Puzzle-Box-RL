Puzzle Box Trial-and-Error Simulation
A simple Python project that demonstrates trial-and-error learning using a puzzle box environment. The program simulates an agent randomly choosing actions and receiving rewards, inspired by basic reinforcement learning concepts.

Description
An agent interacts with a puzzle box.

The agent can perform one of several predefined actions.

Only one action produces a reward.

The agent selects actions randomly over multiple trials.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

Python basics

Functions and loops

Randomized decision-making

Introduction to reinforcement learning ideas

How It Works
1.A list of possible actions is defined.

2.One action is marked as the rewarding action.

3.A function evaluates the selected action.

4.The simulation runs for a fixed number of trials.

5.Each trial prints the chosen action and the reward received.
